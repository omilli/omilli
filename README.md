I've been coding for nearly two decades with 15+ years in a professional capacity.

My core technical skills are advanced JavaScript & CSS in all their flavours.

I recently published my first open-source JavaScript project,Â [hellajs](https://github.com/omilli/hellajs).

Since 2014, I've hired, trained and led 20-30 professionals from Europe and Asia in fully remote, cross-functional Agile teams.

I've worked with clients, designers, developers, content writers and others from the UK, Spain, Vietnam, Singapore, Russia, Estonia, Ukraine, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Canada and USA.
