### üíªüèñÔ∏è‚õ≥üéæü•©üç∑

I've been writing code and building on the web professionally for ~15 years, and nearly two decades in total. Professionally and personally, I wear many hats. My main skills are UI development and technical project management, but each day or hour, I can switch gears and perform a different role if needed.

I've worked remotely with clients, designers, developers, content writers and others from the UK, Spain, Vietnam, Singapore, Russia, Estonia, Ukraine, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Canada and the USA.

As of 2025, I am looking for a new adventure in AI or web3. The chances of joining a digital agency are low (never say never).

I recently published my first open-source project, [Hella](https://github.com/omilli/hella).

# ü¶∏ Alter egos

I could (and do) bore people all day about technologies I use, projects I've been a part of and opinions of best practices for each and every possible situation. Instead, here are the main roles I've played over the years. Expand the drawers for further ramblings.

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Wizard 

**tl;dr**: A remote veteran with technical, creative and management expertise. Thinks getting stuff done is more valuable than knowledge accumulation. Great at making magic... occasionally forgets how to use a pen.

  I'm the technical director at one of the UK's largest event and facility management companies, and I'm responsible for delivering web apps used at some of the UK's largest events, static locations, and public spaces.

  My first lines of company code in 2014 morphed into an ecosystem of real-time web apps and microservices, used 24 hours a day by ~25 back-office staff, hundreds of clients and thousands of ground staff. 

  Over ten years, I have hired, trained and led ~20 remote full-time and freelance staff from Europe and Asia. Our team supports the core business 24 hours a day, and I value personality and teamwork over someone's immediate knowledge of a particular subject or technology.

  I consider myself a web solution architect, a full-stack developer, a UX/UI designer and a technical project manager. I'm passionate about the entire project lifecycle but now focused more on project architecture, UI development, performance, and Agile project management.

### üßë‚Äçüî¨ The Nerd

**tl;dr**: At home (literally and figuratively) building Javascript libraries or using **any** combination of dependencies for **any** project type. A blockchain enthusiast with an eye on web3 development and a basic understanding of smart contracts. `(ts > js && window > global)`

  Back in 2010, I was a jQuery ninja, building UI components and utility libraries with the famous $. I went through a Knockout/Backbone/Ember phase before focusing on React and Angular while still trying everything in between. Of the most recent frameworks, I think Astro and NextJS are the most interesting to work with. 

  Building with zero dependency JavaScript is fun but rarely practical in a work environment. I don't have strong opinions about this vs that framework or library. Everything is just an abstraction, a dialect of a language I've spoken for 15 years.

  Below are some of the technologies I've used over the years. It's not a comprehensive list and excludes anything I know but don't enjoy. 

  - NodeJS
  - Angular Ecosystem
  - React Ecosystem
  - NextJS
  - Ionic
  - Astro
  - HTML/(S)CSS/Tailwind
  - Express/NestJS/MongoDB
  - REST/GraphQL/Websockets
  - Progressive Web Apps
  - Unit Testing (Vitest, Jest, etc...)
  - e2e Testing (Cypress/Playwright)
  - (Web3|Ethers)JS
  - Solidity/Hardhat

  **Please note:**
  I am a senior-level developer with experience and interest in these technologies. I don't use them all daily, and I can't remember/explain every concept off the top of my head. However, I can easily (re)immerse myself in any technology for a relatively short period and bring myself up to speed.

### üßë‚Äçüé® The Creator

**tl;dr**: A failed website designer turned front-end developer accidentally becomes a CSS-driven UI designer. Thinks CSS Designer should be a job title. If my life depended on writing vanilla CSS in a terminal, I'd be fine.

  In one of my first roles I delivered a web app without using any design software. All we had were paper wireframes and an early version of Bootstrap. Turns out I had a skill for creating user-friendly app interfaces, not "pixel-perfect" websites.

  I've always been passionate about designing apps and working with design systems. From a technical perspective, I've journeyed from plain old CSS to LESS and SCSS, then onto Tailwind, PostCSS and CSS-in-JS, and I've always treated CSS as a first-class citizen.

  I think the days of spending hours in design software and handing off static designs are long gone. Much of modern interface design is dynamic, iterative,  and often centres around pre-existing UI libraries. Having a UI/CSS-focused developer, separate from business logic, is a great idea.

### üë®‚Äçüíª The Organizer

**tl;dr**: Occasionally hears "you have OCD". Thinks less is more when it comes to getting the best out of people and treats life like one big project broken into a series of sprints. Loves pattern detection, analysis and making people's lives easier.

  Kanban boards, sprints and to-do lists are at the core of my daily life. My categories have categories, and I prefer frequent communication over maintaining documentation. Building up ideas and then breaking them into manageable chunks is second nature, and visualizing projects as a series of tasks and sub-tasks is a core strength of mine. 

  Since 2014, I've bridged the gap between C-suite/director-level stakeholders, team members and end users, transforming their visions and issues into actions. I thrive on turning ideas into reality and finding solutions to obscure problems. Most things start with ambiguity. If I say "I don't know", it's always followed by "yet".

  I don't have a PM/Scrum certificate, but I've scaled multiple projects in a connected ecosystem and built a solid team over ten years. I've successfully dealt with personnel, budget, deadline, and other hurdles consistently over that period. Even when I'm not working I enjoy solving high level problems at speed while playing and coaching sports, or playing games like chess.
