I've been coding for nearly two decades, with over 15 years of those being in a professional capacity. My core technical skills are still advanced JavaScript & CSS in all their flavours. I would describe my perfect technical role as "Interface Engineer", but you can also find me crafting databases, APIs and CLI tools. At the moment, I'm enjoying working with package-based monorepos, and I recently published my first open-source JavaScript project,Â [hellajs](https://github.com/omilli/hellajs).

Since 2014, I've hired, trained and led 20-30 professionals from Europe and Asia in fully remote, cross-functional Agile teams. I've worked with clients, designers, developers, content writers and others from the UK, Spain, Vietnam, Singapore, Russia, Estonia, Ukraine, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Canada and the USA.
