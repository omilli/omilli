# Profile

I'm the Technical Director at one of the UK's leading event and facility groups. I'm responsible for a web app ecosystem used at the UK's premier events, static locations, and public spaces. My first lines of company code from 2014 morphed into an ecosystem of real-time web apps and services used 24/7 by dozens of back-office staff, hundreds of clients and thousands of ground staff.

Since 2014, I've hired, trained and led 20-30 professionals from Europe and Asia in fully remote, cross-functional Agile teams. I've worked with clients, designers, developers, content writers and others from the UK, Spain, Vietnam, Singapore, Russia, Estonia, Ukraine, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Canada and the USA.

I've been coding for nearly two decades, with over 15 years of those being in a professional capacity. Traditional academia wasn't for me, so I started working with computers after attending a musical academy. I got my first taste of HTML and CSS around 2006, spending the next 4 years studying and freelancing before landing my first full-time front-end developer position. I've always loved designing interfaces with CSS and fell in love with JavaScript by building UIs and components as one of the original jQuery ninjas.

My core technical skills are still advanced JavaScript & CSS in all their flavours. I would describe my perfect technical role as "Interface Engineer", but you can also find me crafting databases, APIs and CLI tools. At the moment, I'm enjoying working with package-based monorepos, and I recently published my first open-source JavaScript project,Â [hella](https://github.com/omilli/hella). I'm also working on a peer-to-peer LLM project that runs in the browser [iplm](https://github.com/omilli/iplm).

Whilst never working primarily as a UX or UI Designer, I've worked with excellent professionals in these fields and have solely created or creatively contributed to many interfaces over two decades. I think pixel-perfection is an impractical, dying myth. Design is about adaptability, user experience, and purpose. True perfection remains unattainable.
